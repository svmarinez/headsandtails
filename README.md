# Headsandtails

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.3.

This is a 100hrs project to solve the problmem of managing a side hustle of mine: petsitting. 
As an unorganized person, this project will be beneficial for other people who are equally disorganized and petsit or for folks trying to connect with petsitters regardless of their shoddy organization skills.
Version 1.0 is meant to be done using Angular but reproducing the project using another Front-end framework is being evaluated.
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
